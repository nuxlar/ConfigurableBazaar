# ConfigurableBazaar
**WORK IN PROGRESS**

Working to make the bazaar completely configurable through rolls, interactables, prices, and portal spawns. Bazaar kickout is now removed.
Currently has configuration for:

	- portal spawns!
	- a scrapper
	- printers (up to 4)
	- a cleansing pool
	- an extra cauldron (green to white or red to white)

## Config Info
**Portal Config:**
* 0 for no change (default), 12345 for a portal every stage
* the numbers apply to both pre and post loop
* the stage numbers that aren't in WONT spawn a portal even if you hit a newt shrine e.g. (135 wont spawn portals on stages 4 and 5)
